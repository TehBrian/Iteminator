## About
Iteminator is a fresh take on in-game Minecraft item editing. It offers a simple
command UX powered by tab-completion while still allowing you to modify all item
data available. No cluttered, sludgy GUIs. Just the raw power of the game's item
system in your hands.

## Features

- Edit all item data. Seriously. All of it. This includes books, maps,
  fireworks, and even tropical fish buckets.
- Use either [MiniMessage][MiniMessage] or legacy formatting to format text.
- All plugin messages are easily configurable.
